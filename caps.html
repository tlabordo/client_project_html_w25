            <p>AUniversity Health & Counseling (UHC) supports the health and well-being of the campus community. We are
                inspired to help students realize their potential, cope with the stresses of life, work productively,

            <p>UHC is made up of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), which offers counseling services, and

                services and take positive pathways to mental health. We are happy to offer both in-person and virtual
                services. </p>
